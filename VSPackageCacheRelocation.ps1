.Synopsis
Move the Burn package cache to another drive or directory.
.Description
Actually moving the Burn package cache to another drive or directory is currently not supported.
Instead this script creates a expandable virtual disk (VHD) in whatever directory you want - even on another drive.
Any existing payload is copied and the expandable virtual disk is mounted into the now empty package cache.
.Parameter Path
The directory in which the package cache is moved.
.Parameter Size
The maximum size of the expandable virtual disk to create. The default is 1TB.
.Notes
You need administrator privileges to run this script.
